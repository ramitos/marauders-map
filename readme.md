## api

### map(port)
This will start a tcp server that will listen to `reveal` announcements

```js
var map = require('marauders-map').map(4546)
```

Returns a map instance that contains the `seek` function

### reveal(port, node)
`port`: the port to announce the node. It needs to be the same port used in the map function

```js
reveal(4546, {
  name: 'web',
  subdomain: 'web',
  routes: [
    '/:method/:id': ['get', 'post', 'delete'],
    '/:method': ['put']
  ],
  port: 6078
})
```

Node parameters:
 * `name` (**required**) the name is completely irrelevant. It's only used to map the various nodes and to avoid repeated nodes. This means that you can announce the same node multiple times with differente configurations that the mapping will adjust
 * `port` (**required**) the port were this port is listening
 * `subdomain`(*optional*) This node will only be considered when the request subdomain matches the defined subdomain. If not defined, only is considered with requests with no subdomain. *In the future the idea is to allow subdomain matching like `*.domain.com`*
 * `routes` (*optional*) This node will only be considered when the routes and the methods match. You can also define routes like `routes: ['/']` where all methods are considered
 * you can pass other parameters that you find usefull. The object is not modified.

### seek(http request, callback)
```js
map.seek({
  headers: {host: 'web.lvh.me'},
  method: 'GET',
  url: '/get/5'
}, function (node) {
  assert(node.port === 6078)
})
```
